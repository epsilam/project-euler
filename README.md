# project-euler
This is a collection of my solutions for Project Euler problems written in Haskell.
Many problems have been written in their own separate files, but some of the simpler ones have been combined in `solutions/simple-problems.hs`.

Currently, the problems with full solutions are
1 - 25, 27, 28, 622.
The `solutions` directory also contains partial/incomplete solutions for various other problems.
