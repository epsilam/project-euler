# project-euler

This is a collection of my solutions for Project Euler problems written in Haskell.

The problems themselves can be found at https://projecteuler.net/archives.

Many solutions have been written in their own separate files in the `solutions/` directory (e.g., the solution for problem 622 can be found in `solutions/0622.hs`), but some of the simpler ones have been combined in a single file at `solutions/simple-problems.hs`.

Some solutions rely on functions defined in the EulerFunctions library in `solutions/EulerFunctions.hs`.

Currently, the problems with full solutions are
1 - 25, 27 - 30, 35, 36, 622.
The `solutions` directory also contains partial/incomplete solutions for various other problems.
